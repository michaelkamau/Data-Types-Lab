# Data Types Lab
--
This is a lab exercise that explore some of the built-in data types in python.

A single function ```data_type``` is defined that accepts a single argument. This function returns an outcome dependding
on the type of the argument that is passed to the function.

The following rules apply:
* For ```string```, return its length.
* For ```None``` return string ```no value```
* For ```bool``` return the boolean
* For ```int``` return a string showing how it compares to 100
* For ```list```s return the 3rd item, or ```None``` if it doesn't exist


## Why am I doing this?

This labs are part of the Andela boot-camp activities, which am currently participating in.

Feel free to comment on the code or ask any questions about the boot-camp.
